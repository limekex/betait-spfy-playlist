# BSPFY – Spotify Playlist Plugin (v2)

A lightweight, organized foundation for playing Spotify tracks/playlists inside WordPress using the Spotify Web API + Web Playback SDK with secure OAuth 2.0 PKCE.

## Contents

This repo includes:

* `.gitignore` — Files excluded from version control.
* `CHANGELOG.md` — Project changes.
* `README.md` — The file you’re reading.
* A `betait-spfy-playlist` directory — the full, executable WordPress plugin source.

## Features

* Secure **OAuth 2.0 PKCE** via WP REST endpoints under `/wp-json/bspfy/v1/oauth/*`.
* **httpOnly** cookie token storage (configurable SameSite/Secure).
* **Web Playback SDK** for in-browser playback *(Spotify Premium required for end users)*.
* Role/membership gate via `bspfy_can_play` filter.
* Uniform error handling for 401/403/429 with silent refresh + backoff.
* Debug flag (`BSPFY_DEBUG`) with masked logs.

## Installation

Copy the `betait-spfy-playlist` folder into `wp-content/plugins/` and activate it in **Plugins**.

If you fork/rename the plugin, update identifiers accordingly (examples):
* rename folder `betait-spfy-playlist` → `example-me`
* change function/variable prefixes `bspfy_` → `example_`
* change text domain `betait-spfy-playlist` → `example-me`
* change main class `Betait_Spfy_Playlist` → `Example_Me`

## Quick Setup

1. **Create a Spotify app** and add a redirect URI:  
   `https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/bspfy/v1/oauth/callback`
2. In `wp-config.php`, optionally set:
   ```php
   define('BSPFY_DEBUG', true);
   define('BSPFY_STRICT_SAMESITE', true);
   define('BSPFY_REQUIRE_PREMIUM', true);
3. Place a connect/play UI in your theme/admin as needed; the client helper is available via `window.bspfyAuth`.
